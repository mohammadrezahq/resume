    "about": "I am Mohammadreza Haghshenas (Mohammadrezahq), I was born in Tehran/Iran on 2002. I enjoy working on a web app especially when it's written in PHP and Laravel. I started web developing in 2014 with HTML/CSS & PHP. In 2016 I started learning PHP MVC, WordPress development concurrently with Laravel framework development. Also I worked with Web frameworks of other languages like NestJs and Django-rest-framework (just a little). Because of working with pure PHP and WordPress, I work on both front and back (front with HTML 5/CSS 3/SCSS/jQuery), And as a full-stack Web developer, I can work with Vue js framework and a little React js. I am interested in DevOps consepts like CI/CD, Linux (LPIC), Virtualization, Docker, Kubernetes and more. At the moment I am trying to learn GoLang as my new adventure.",
